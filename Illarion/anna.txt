You want to be promoted? Why shall I promoted someone who is not even able to work with a coworker? If you ever want me to see you as the reasonable person worth to overpower another noble show me that you can put grieve aside for higher aims. Replacing someone who does not what you like him to do is easy but will improve things only for a moment. Help the one you shall work with to use their potential, in order to become the persons you hope they can be one day. This means being patient with them and giving them any chance to develop. Because I think this way you did become a noble and still are one. Some of your choice made me consider to replace you too and I think you aware of this. When you look back you sure won't be able to deny that you did learn a lot on your way to this point.
The Baron did earn his rank by hard work as you did and even if you love to point out his wrongs did a lot of things what strengthened Cadomyr. One important thing any leader needs to do is to make people use their strengths. The Baron and his strong faith are popular among the lizardmen, he is a good warrior, and loyal to me as can be. Sure with his claws he never will be a master bard and play the lute or harp. He is a Baron of Cadomyr because he has certain strengths he uses for Cadomyr in this position. Therefor his aims are supported and become the aims of the realm to a certain extend.
You show potential and engagement in politics and foreign affairs, you proved all Cadomyr that you are a builder, and you gathered the right people to delegate tasks to.
